# Fantasy Elite Wrestling

Fantasy Wrestling for All Elite Wrestling fans.

## Description

Think fantasy football but with steel cage matches and chair shots.
A web app where you can create your own fantasy wrestling league or join a friend's league by invite. Then, you create your team and draft players into it and gain points based on wins, championship defends, and bonus points like: interference, steel stairs, and fighting in the crowd.

## The Why

I'm a huge pro wrestling fan and I'm also into gamifying anything and everything, including watching wrestling. My friends and I have been using another fantasy wrestling web app for about a year now for our competitve wrestling-watching and it's been a fun experience but there are some features that I'd really love to have in a fantasy league that aren't available there. For example, I'd like to have a way to initiate trades between teams, add chat or messaging options, and allow admins to run special week by week outcome betting or their league (like "Top points earner this week", "Amount of interference points scored this week", etc..)
